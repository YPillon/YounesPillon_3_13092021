In this project, I implemented the frontend of Ohmyfood in a static manner, with animations.

Ohmyfood is a reservation platform for Gastronomic restaurants in Paris, made for people who love good food but don't have much time
to wait for ordering and cooking.
They can choose on the platform their menu and the time when they want to eat, then order and comme on time to eat their meal.
